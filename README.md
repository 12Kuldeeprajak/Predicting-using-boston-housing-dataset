Boston House Dataset: descriptive and inferential statistics, and prediction of the variable price .
About The Boston Housing Dataset
Boston housing is a classic dataset described in detail at University of Toronto's Website, and the data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

Dataset Naming: The name for this dataset is simply boston. It has two prototasks: nox, in which the nitrous oxide level is to be predicted; and price, in which the median value of a home is to be predicted. However, here, I am using everything to predict price.
